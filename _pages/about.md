I am a third year Ph.D. student in University of California, Irvine. My advisor is [Nathan Kaplan](https://www.math.uci.edu/~nckaplan/). Currently, my research is the interplay of coding theory and arithmetic geometry over finite fields. I am also interested in arithmetic statistics and moments of $L$-functions.
Besides math, I like learning Data Science and thinking fun puzzles.
