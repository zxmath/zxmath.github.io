I am a third year Ph. D. student in University of California, Irvine. My advisor is [Nathan Kaplan](https://www.math.uci.edu/~nckaplan/). Currently, my research is focusing the interplay of coding theory and arithmetic geometry over finite fields. I am also interestied in arithmetic statistics and moments of L-functions.
